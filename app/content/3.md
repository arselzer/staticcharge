#### Version Control

I had already started with parts of the project in the Summer Holidays (2013).
They were not under Version Control.
In fact, I did not even know how to use git at the time.

This was before the project officially started, but I already knew what I would choose,
and busily planning the project.

The Branches Logo

We designed a logo for the Branches network and planned the layout.

After spending time on other projects, I came back to Branches. I understood git by then,
and had another server. A HP Proliant Server with 1TB RAID.

I set up a git server, Node.js, and Nginx on it, for use as a development server.

It was used like a central versioning system (yuck), and was somehow badly-configured.
This led to frustration, but it was due to my lack of knowledge in configuring the parts
of the server at the time, and my low experience with Git.

The Server

------

I had always established a SSH session to the development server, in which I worked on Branches.
Besides that, a SSH tunnel forwarded the port of the development server.

This soon became problematic. Now it is hard to believe that I ever set up everything so inconveniently.
I like working in the train, in school, and everywhere, but to do this I needed an internet connection
to reach my server at home. The phone, which was used as a router started overheating, and the battery
was empty quickly. Also, the connection dropped frequently, which was plainly annoying.

The solution to this was to simply use Git as what it was meant to be. As a Decentralized Versioning System,
not a centralized one.

Decentralized Versioning Systems

------

I started using Git normally, and the configuration of the server started to improve.

Soon something else was about to change. I started to really appreciate GitHub, and its services.
It was much more comfortable to host a private GitHub repository than to host the own server. Also,
it is more robust, as I am depending on the connection of my ISP. Download speed is much faster too.

Then I upgraded my account to be able to host 5 private repositories.
I created a GitHub organization for Branches, which would also be used to host the open-source
parts of the application, and the public libraries for connecting to it.

This again greatly improved the workflow.

------

#### The Application

From the beginning on I attempted to take care of organizing Branches well, but it took two rewrites
for the structure to finally work well.

At the beginning, the application did not follow any guidelines for structure. While it certainly was
not entirely badly-structured for a small application, it soon started to become a problem. It turned out that I
took modularity to its extremes (creating an over-modular app). Also, I misunderstood npm modules. Everything was
a module from the start.

It turned out that this was not a good strategy, although it was carefully planned.

After I did not work on Branches for almost one month, and came back to it after doing two smaller projects,
I realized how horrible my structure was. It was *too* carefully planned with placeholders everywhere, while actually
finding what I was looking for was very hard.

Determined to convert to a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, I researched and found Sails.js.
It seemed to be the most active Node.js MVC Framework available, and Branches was immediately converted
to it. At the time, it was also moved to GitHub, so I decided to remove all history and start from scratch,
just taking what was needed.

Soon I realized Sails.js was not what I wanted. It tried to do too much, over which I wanted full control.
Sails partially controlls the client-side stack, which is something I do not want a server-side framework to do.
It modified template files in unpredictable ways, and included libraries. It started websocket servers, which I did
not want.

Branches Organized

While Sails is a great framework for many, it did not fit into Branches, so I decided to rewrite it again.

Like before, I was again to use Express, but in a well-organized way, in a MVC Application.

A few days later it was done, and Branches was beautifully organized, even more organized than my other projects had been.

------

#### Testing

When I started with Branches, I did not see the importance of testing. Features ended up broken easily.

However, after starting to use AngularJS, it became much clearer to me. I started using front-end tests.

Then, after rewriting as MVC Express, I started including Mocha tests.

Mocha is a very powerful testing framework. It supports many styles of testing, helpful reporters, and makes
testing both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript easy.

------

### Implementation of the System

One of the most important parts in implementing Branches was finding information for solving problems.
Luckily, this information is available in form of the sources referenced here.

Implementing something like Branches was a big and challenging task.
I worked on necessary administrative tasks beside the main project:

``Note: Most information is not shown, as it would leak data about Branches, which has to yet fully launch``
